You have been given a queue of integers. You need to rearrange the elements of the queue by interleaving the elements of the first half of the queue with the second half.
Note :
The given queue will always be of even length.
For Example :
If N= 10
and Q = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
then the output will be
 Q = [10, 60, 20, 70, 30, 80, 40, 90, 50, 100]
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases are as follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer 'N' which denotes the size of the queue.

The second line of each test case contains elements of the queue. The line consists of values of elements of the queue separated by a single space.
Output Format:
For each test case, print the elements of the queue after interleaving the elements of the first half with the second half.

public class Solution {
    public static void interLeaveQueue(Queue < Integer > q) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int size = q.size();
        int i =size;
        while(i>size/2){
            queue.add(q.remove());
            i--;
        }
        
        while(i>0){
            q.add(queue.remove());
            q.add(q.remove());
            i--;
        }
        
    }
}
